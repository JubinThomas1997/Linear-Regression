# Linear Regression

This is a project to implement Simple and Multiple Linear Regression on the same dataset that is related to Fuel Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Emission of Cars. Simple Linear Regression is a technique used to model the relationship between two numeric variables: an independent variable ( 'Fuel Consumption' in this project) and a dependent variable ( 'CO2 Emission' in this project), while in Multiple Linear Regression uses two or more independent variables. The goal is to find a linear equation that best represents the relationship between the variables so that we can make predictions based on new values of the independent variable(s).
